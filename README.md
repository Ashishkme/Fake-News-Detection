# Fake-News-Detection-Project.

# Overview
This Fake News Detection project aims to classify news articles as **fake** or **real** using machine learning algorithms. With the rise of misinformation on digital platforms, this tool helps identify unreliable content, enhancing trust in online information sources.

# Features
**Data Collection:** Gathers news articles from various sources.
**Data Preprocessing:** Cleans and prepares the data for analysis.
**Feature Extraction:** Uses techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings to convert text into numerical features.
**Model Training:** Implements algorithms like Support Vector Machine (SVM), Naïve Bayes, and Logistic Regression for classification.
**Evaluation:** Assesses model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
**Deployment:** Deploys the model as a web service for real-time detection.

# Dataset
The project uses datasets from reliable sources such as Kaggle's Fake News Dataset. Download and place it in the `data/` folder.

# Models Used
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
- **Naïve Bayes**
- **Logistic Regression**

## Results
The best-performing model achieved an accuracy of X% on the test dataset, providing a robust tool for fake news classification.

## Future Enhancements
- **Integration with Deep Learning Models** (e.g., LSTM, BERT)
- **Real-Time Detection on Social Media**
- **Multi-Language Support**
