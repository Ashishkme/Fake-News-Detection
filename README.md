# Fake-News-Detection-Project.

# Overview
This project aims to develop a system for detecting fake news articles using natural language processing (NLP) techniques and machine learning algorithms. The system classifies news articles as real or fake based on their content.

# Features
Data Collection: Gathers news articles from various sources.
Data Preprocessing: Cleans and prepares the data for analysis.
Feature Extraction: Uses techniques like TF-IDF or word embeddings.
Model Training: Trains machine learning models such as Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes, or Neural Networks.
Evaluation: Assesses model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Deployment: Deploys the model as a web service for real-time detection.
